# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project named "lowson" that scrapes Lawson convenience store food data and provides calorie optimization tools. The project uses uv for dependency management and includes pandas for data processing, requests for web scraping, and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing.

## Development Commands

### Package Management
- `uv sync` - Install/update dependencies and sync environment
- `uv add <package>` - Add new dependencies
- `uv remove <package>` - Remove dependencies
- `uv lock` - Update lockfile

### Running the Application
- `uv run python scraping.py` - Run the web scraper to collect food data
- `uv run python knapsack_optimizer.py` - Run the calorie optimizer
- `uv run <command>` - Run any command within the project environment

### Project Structure
- `scraping.py` - Web scraper for Lawson food data
- `knapsack_optimizer.py` - Calorie optimization using dynamic programming
- `dataset/source.json` - Contains URLs for Lawson convenience store product categories
- `dataset/lawson_food_data.csv` - Scraped food data (generated by scraping.py)
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration and dependencies
- `uv.lock` - Dependency lockfile managed by uv

## Dependencies

The project currently depends on:
- `pandas>=2.3.1` - For data manipulation and analysis
- `requests` - For HTTP requests to scrape web data
- `beautifulsoup4` - For HTML parsing
- Python 3.13+ required

## Features

### Web Scraping (`scraping.py`)
- Scrapes Lawson convenience store website for food items
- Extracts product names, calories, and prices
- Saves data to CSV format
- Includes rate limiting and error handling

### Calorie Optimization (`knapsack_optimizer.py`)
- Uses dynamic programming to solve the knapsack problem
- Maximizes calories within a given budget
- Provides interactive budget optimization
- Shows most calorie-efficient items
- Analyzes multiple budget scenarios

## Data Sources

The `dataset/source.json` file contains URLs for various Lawson product categories:
- Gateau (cakes)
- Desserts
- Rice dishes
- Sandwiches
- Bakery items
- Pasta
- Noodles
- Salads
- Fried items
- Frozen select items

## Usage

1. First, run the scraper to collect data: `uv run python scraping.py`
2. Then, run the optimizer to find optimal food combinations: `uv run python knapsack_optimizer.py`
